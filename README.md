Intel Quartus (18.1) BKM-68X FPGA Project

This project has the BKM-68X-FPGA repository as a submodule and is meant as the "gateway" to actually get the code onto a FPGA.

The project revolves around the Intel/Altera MAX 10 10M08SCE8G FPGA. It is grossly overkill (code takes 10% of logic) so smaller could most likely easily work.
